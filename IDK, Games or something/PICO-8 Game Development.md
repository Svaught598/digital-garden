# PICO-8
## About
PICO-8 is a fantasy console where you can develop minimal games and programs using Lua and an assortment of built-in tools. There's a lot of quirks to the platform, and a lot of math inside of game physics, so there's a lot to take notes on. [PICO-8 Homepage](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php)

These are interesting areas of game development I want to learn more about. They aren't strictly related to PICO-8, but will probably be explored with PICO-8 in mind.
