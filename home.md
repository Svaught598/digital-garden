# Woah! KNOWLEDGE. ðŸ“š

I'm pretty bad at keeping consistent at blogging. But I like to write small things here and there, just to get thoughts to paper, so I created this knowledge garden. But ultimately, this is just a place for me to record my ideas and easily reference resources to people out in the world. 

## Stuff you might find here

No promises, but you might find information about Math/Physics/Programming/Philosophy. Or not. We'll just have to wait and see what this garden evolves into.

## Stuff you won't find here

- Whatever you're looking for
- Garbanzo Beans
- Lost relatives
- TV Remote (check the couch cushions)

## Stuff that is here
